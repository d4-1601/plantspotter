# Plant Spotter
An app for identifying plants. By taking a picture or uploading a photo of a plant it will suggest the best result from the [plant.id API](https://plant.id/).

This app was a solo project for the CodeWorks coding bootcamp and was built within a week. Presentation of the app is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dDHbwZbm78)

This app is built for testing and educational purposes and is not intended to be published. Built using React-Native with Expo and Firebase authentication for the front-end. Node JS, [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) for the back-end. I had used [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to publicly service the localhost for testing. Requests from back-end sent to [plant.id API](https://plant.id/) to identify plants.
